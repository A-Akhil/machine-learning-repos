# Ecommerce product categorization

## Goal
This project implements an automated product categorization system for e-commerce platforms using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The system analyzes product descriptions, titles, and metadata to automatically assign products to the most relevant categories. The solution handles large datasets, and continuously improves product discoverability and categorization consistency.

It deals with organizing our ecommerce products into categories and tags that give us a system to get customers to the exact product they are looking for quicker. This includes creating categories, tags, attributes and more to create a hierarchy for similar products.
